# electron_app_code_injection
#
# This analytical may be used to monitor attempts at code injection into Electron applications on macOS, particularly searching for the usage of the --inspect= argument that could lead into take over of macOS applications TCC permissions.
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type  == 1 AND
$event.process.path CONTAINS ".app" AND
$event.process.args.@count > 0 AND
(ANY $event.process.args IN {"--inspect=", "--remote-de-bugging-port"})


# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
Severity: Medium
Categories: Process Injection
