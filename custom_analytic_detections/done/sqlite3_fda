# sqlite3_fda
#
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report when sqlite3 is used to interact with the TCC database to show apps with full disk access.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation involving a binary carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.sqlite3' and process arguments containing "tcc.db" and "kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles".
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.sqlite3" AND
$event.process.args.@count > 0 AND
((ANY $event.process.args == "tcc.db") AND (ANY $event.process.args == "kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles"))

# Required Analytic Configuration:
Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
Severity: Informational
