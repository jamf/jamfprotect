# nmap_scan_ip_blocks
#
# This analytic predicate may be used to report on scanning ip blocks with nmap on an endpoint.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process activity using the nmap binary to process arguments containing "-sS -sV -Pn {IPRANGE} -p {PORTS}".
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.path.lastPathComponent == "nmap" AND
$event.process.commandLine MATCHES ".*nmap\\s+(?:-[sSVPn]{0,2}\\s+){0,3}?(?:\\d{1,3}\\.){3}?\\d{1,3}\\/\\d{1,2}\\s\\-p\\s(?:\\d+(?:\\,\\d+)*)?"
