# known_vulnerable_log4j_jar_file_installation
#
# This Custom Analytic predicate may be used to detect .jar files created on the host system that are known to be vulnerable to log4shell-related attacks.  Affected .jar file names referenced from https://github.com/mubix/CVE-2021-44228-Log4Shell-Hashes/blob/main/sha256sums.txt. 
# This detection functions by monitoring for the creation of the jar files. 

# NOTE: This will not monitor for or alert to .jar files existing on the system prior to this Custom Analytic being enabled, only those that are newly created after the fact.

# Analytic Predicate(s):

$event.type == 0 AND
$event.path.pathExtension ==[cd] "jar" AND
$event.path MATCHES ".*(apache-)?log4j-(\\d+(\\.|-)){1,3}((rc|beta)\\d+-)?(bin|alpha\\d+(-bin)?)/log4j-core-(?!2\\.3\\.[1-9]|2\\.17\\.[0-9]|2\\.12\\.[3-9])(\\d+(\\.|-)?){1,3}((alpha|beta|rc)\\d+)?\.jar"

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: File System Event

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:

Severity: Informational
Level: 0
