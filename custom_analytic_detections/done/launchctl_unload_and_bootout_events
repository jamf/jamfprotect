# launchctl_unload_and_bootout_events
#
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report on all unload or bootout events by the 'launchctl' binary.
# This detection functions by monitoring for processes created by the launchctl binary where a process argument contains the 'unload' or 'bootout' arguments.
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.xpc.launchctl" AND
$event.process.args.@count > 0 AND
(ANY $event.process.args IN {"unload", "bootout"})

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
Severity: Informational
