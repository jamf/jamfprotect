# printer_activity
#
# This analytic predicate may be used to report on printer activity on the endpoint.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation involving binaries carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.socket', 'com.apple.ipp', 'com.apple.lpd', or 'com.apple.usb' with a responsible process creation involving a binary carrying the signing info of 'com.apple.cupsd'.
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid IN {'com.apple.socket', 'com.apple.ipp', 'com.apple.lpd', 'com.apple.usb'} AND
$event.process.responsible.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.cupsd"

Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

Context Items: 
Name: print job command
