# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation involving a binary carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.zgrep' or 'com.apple.grep', a process group leader carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.ioreg', and a process argument containing " CGSSession".
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.path.lastPathComponent == "grep" AND
(ANY $event.process.args == "CGSSession") AND
$event.process.pgprocess.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.ioreg"

# Required Analytic Configuration:
