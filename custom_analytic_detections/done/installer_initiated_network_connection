# installer_initiated_network_connection
#
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report on the Installer process invoking nscurl or curl when a pre or post install script has ran, potentially retrieving files from a remote server.
# This detection functions by monitoring for the process creation involving curl or nscurl where the responsible process is Installer and the parent process is a shell.
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.path.lastPathComponent IN {"curl", "nscurl"} AND
$event.process.parent.isShell == true AND
$event.process.responsible.path.lastPathComponent == "Installer"

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
Severity: Informational
