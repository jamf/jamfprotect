# all_caffeinate_activity_on_interactive_command_line
#
# This Custom Analytic may be used to report on all usage of the 'caffeinate' binary on an interactive command line such as Terminal or through a script.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process spawns by a binary with the 'caffeinate' app ID that have an associated tty and a parent process that is a shell.

# The 'caffeinate' binary is commonly used to alter system sleep behaviour and may leave a system awake and unlocked.

# Analytic Predicate(s):

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.tty != nil AND
$event.process.parent.isShell == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.caffeinate"

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:

Severity: Informational
Level: 0
