# keychain_copied
#
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report on .keychain-db files being copied over
# This detection functions by monitoring for process activity using the mv, ditto or cp binaries to copy .keychain-db files over to other locations, in case of a healthy keychain this should not happen.
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND 
$event.process.path.lastPathComponent IN {'mv', 'ditto', 'cp'} AND 
$event.process.args.@count > 0 AND
(ANY $event.process.args == ".keychain-db")

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
Severity: Low
Categoriies: Visibility, CredentialAccess
