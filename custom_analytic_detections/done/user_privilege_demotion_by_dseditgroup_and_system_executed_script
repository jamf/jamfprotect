# user_privilege_demotion_by_dseditgroup_and_system_executed_script
# 
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report on a user's privilege removal through a shell script with the 'dseditgroup' binary and initiated by a system task.  This method is commonly used by organisations to demote users automatically as a part of a self-initiated escalation process from Self Service.
# This Analytic pairs well with the user_privilege_escalation_by_dseditgroup_binary_and_jamf_self_service custom Analytic also in this repository.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation with a binary carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.dseditgroup', a command-line argument of '-o edit -d' (required to escalate privileges with this binary) and with the parent process originating from a script / system task, such as a LaunchDaemon.
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.dseditgroup" AND
$event.process.commandLine CONTAINS "-o edit -d" AND
$event.process.parent.commandLine CONTAINS "/PATH/TO/SCRIPT.SH"

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

IMPORTANT: The predicate must be updated to accurately reflect the path to the shell script executing the dseditgroup command.

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
Severity: Informational
