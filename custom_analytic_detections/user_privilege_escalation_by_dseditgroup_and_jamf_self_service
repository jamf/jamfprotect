# user_privilege_escalation_by_dseditgroup_and_jamf_self_service
#
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report on a user's privilege escalation with the 'dseditgroup' binary and initiated through Self Service.  This method is commonly used by organisations to offer user's the ability to elevate their privileges temporarily on their endpoint.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation with a binary carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.dseditgroup', a command-line argument of '-o edit -a' (required to escalate privileges with this binary) and with the parent process originating from the Jamf Pro management framework's application support directory.
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND $event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.dseditgroup" AND $event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] "-o edit -a" AND $event.process.parent.commandLine CONTAINS "/Library/Application Support/JAMF/"

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
Severity: Informational
