# dns_service_discovery
#
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report when dns-sd is used for local network service discovery.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation involving a binary carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.dns-sd' and a process argument matches ".*-B\\s\\_\\w.*?\\.\\_tcp".
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.dns-sd" AND
$event.process.commandLine MATCHES ".*-B\\s\\_\\w.*?\\.\\_tcp"

# Required Analytic Configuration:
Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
