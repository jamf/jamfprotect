# lockscreen_check
#
# This Analytic predicate may be used to report when ioreg is used to check if the macOS screen is locked.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation involving a binary carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.zgrep' or 'com.apple.grep', a process group leader carrying the signing information of 'com.apple.ioreg', and a process argument containing " CGSSession".
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.signingInfo.appid IN {"com.apple.zgrep","com.apple.grep"} AND
$event.process.commandLine CONTAINS[cd] " CGSSession" AND
$event.process.pgprocess.signingInfo.appid == "com.apple.ioreg"

# Required Analytic Configuration:
