# sysctl_activity
#
# This analytic predicate may be used to report on any system_profiler activity on the endpoint that involves an interactive shell and prints hardware related information.
# This detection functions by monitoring for process creation involving a process path where the last path component is system_profiler, a TTY is assigned and at least one argument is provided that matches "SPHardwareDataType"
#
# Analytic Predicate:

$event.type == 1 AND
$event.process.tty != nil AND
$event.process.path.lastPathComponent == "system_profiler"
$event.process.args.@count > 0 AND
(ANY $event.process.args IN {"SPHardwareDataType", "SPSoftwareDataType", "SPDisplayDataType"})

# Required Analytic Configuration:

Sensor Event Type: Process Event
Level: 0

# Recommended Analytic Configuration:
Severity: Informational
