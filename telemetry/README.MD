# Telemetry

The folders in this repository offer guidance and examples pertinent to using Telemetry in Jamf Protect.

In this repository you will find examples for:
- [Simple Log File Collection](./simple_log_file_collection/)
- [macOS Detection Rules](./detection_rules/)

The detection rules in the [Detection Rules](./detection_rules/) folder are written in [Sigma](https://sigmahq.io/), an open standard for writing detection rules. This allows for easy conversion to any supported SIEM data model format using tools such as [sigconverter.io](https://sigconverter.io/).
