# gatekeeper_file_apen_rejections_and_user_bypasses
#
# This Unified Log filter may be used to report on events where a user is prevented from accessing a file by double-click, as well as when that user then right-click and chooses to bypass Gatekeeper to open the file anyway.
# This filter functions by monitoring logging containing event messaging with a known string indicating a bypass event occurred.  Please note that the typo in 'sucessfully' is required due to a typo in macOS logging.
#
# Filter Predicate:

subsystem == "com.apple.launchservices" AND process == "CoreServicesUIAgent" AND category == "uiagent" AND (eventMessage BEGINSWITH "Saving rejection record:" OR eventMessage CONTAINS "Gatekeeper rejection record")

# Example Output:
